## Flex Lexer Documentation

 Introduction

This repository contains the Flex lexer code for tokenizing a Java-like programming language. The lexer is designed to recognize various components of the input code and classify them into different token types.

 Repository Structure

lexer.l: This file contains the Flex lexer code responsible for tokenizing the input code.
README.md: This README file provides an overview of the repository and instructions for usage.
LICENSE: This file contains the license information for the repository.

 Usage

To use the Flex lexer:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    bash
    cd <repository-directory>
    

3. Compile the Flex lexer:

    bash
    flex lexer.l
    

4. Compile the generated C file:

    bash
    cc lex.yy.c -o lexer -lfl
    

5. Run the lexer with input code:

    bash
    ./lexer <input-file>
    

   Replace `<input-file>` with the path to your input code file.

 Token Types

The lexer recognizes the following types of tokens:

1. Keywords: Reserved words in the programming language with special meanings.
2. Data Types: Represent the type of data that a variable can hold.
3. Operators: Perform operations on variables and values.
4. Special Characters: Symbols with specific purposes in the code.
5. Identifiers: Names given to variables, functions, classes, etc.
6. Literals: Fixed values in the code, such as numbers, strings, and characters.
7. Control Statements: Used to control the flow of execution in the program.
8. Print and Input Statements: Statements for printing output and reading input.
9. Others: Placeholders, semicolons, braces, etc.
